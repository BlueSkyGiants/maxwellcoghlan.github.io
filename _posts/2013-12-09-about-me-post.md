## A little bit about me
  <p>
  <img border = "0" style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" SRC="/portrait2.jpg" align ="right" >
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning my undergraduate work in CU Boulderâ€™s school of Engineering, I found my true passion lies with logic and analysis, working extensively in upper division coursework which require technical skills. Having taken interdisciplinary classes requiring heavy knowledge in STATA, Python, C++, Excel, and other technical languages useful in data analysis have really tested my ability to adapt and strive with foreign concepts. On multiple occasions, I have worked with large data sets analyzing and creating new metrics, all the while providing contextual relationships between variables. My experience in physics has given me a unique outlook and the tools to approach problems which require intensive technical analysis.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the Head undergraduate tutor in the Economics department, it is often required that I explain complex economic concepts with intricate rationale to students with ranging knowledge on the subject. Student questions challenged my critical thinking skills since conveying the underlying reasoning requires conceptualizing, analyzing, and synthesizing the inquiry. With this position and years of working in the service industry, I have learned how to facilitate customer satisfaction by going the extra mile and surpassing expectations.
